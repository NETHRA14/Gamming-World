                Console Gaming: Consoles like Sony's PlayStation, Microsoft's Xbox, and Nintendo's Switch are leading platforms. Each has its exclusive titles, like The Last of Us on PlayStation or Halo on Xbox.
                Mobile Gaming: Mobile gaming is a massive segment, especially in regions like Asia. Games like PUBG Mobile, Candy Crush, and Genshin Impact have millions of daily active users. The free-to-play model with in-app purchases is common.

Streaming live gameplay or making gaming-related content (reviews, guides, let's plays) has become a career for many, with top streamers like Ninja or PewDiePie gaining massive followings and revenue.

                Cross-Play and Cross-Progression: More games now support cross-play, allowing users on different platforms to play together. Cross-progression, as seen in games like Fortnite and Call of Duty, lets players maintain progress across multiple devices.Future Trends
